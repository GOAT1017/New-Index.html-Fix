# CeFi Security Guide

## Securing Your Centralized Exchange Accounts

Centralized exchanges (CeFi) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken are popular entry points into cryptocurrency trading. However, they require careful security setup to protect your funds.

### Essential Security Steps

#### 1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- **Why:** 2FA is your first line of defense against unauthorized access
- **How:** 
  - Download Google Authenticator or Authy
  - Go to Security Settings in your exchange
  - Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
  - Save backup codes in a secure location

#### 2. Set Up API Keys Properly
- **Trading-Only Permissions:** Never enable withdrawal permissions on API keys
- **IP Whitelisting:** Restrict API access to specific IP addresses
- **Regular Rotation:** Change API keys every 3-6 months

#### 3. Configure Withdrawal Settings
- **Withdrawal Limits:** Set daily/monthly limits appropriate for your trading
- **Whitelisted Addresses:** Only allow withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses
- **Email Confirmations:** Enable email verification for all withdrawals

#### 4. Account Monitoring
- **Login Notifications:** Enable email alerts for new device logins
- **Activity Monitoring:** Regularly review account activity logs
- **Suspicious Activity:** Report any unauthorized access immediately

### Security Checklist
- [ ] 2FA enabled on account
- [ ] Strong, unique password set
- [ ] API keys configured with minimal permissions
- [ ] Withdrawal limits and whitelists configured
- [ ] Email notifications enabled
- [ ] Backup codes stored securely offline

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using SMS for 2FA (use authenticator apps instead)
- Sharing API keys or login credentials
- Keeping large amounts on exchanges long-term
- Using the same password across multiple exchanges

### Emergency Procedures
If you suspect your account is compromised:
1. **Immediately** change your password
2. Disable all API keys
3. Contact exchange support
4. Review and secure your email account
5. Check for unauthorized trades or withdrawals
