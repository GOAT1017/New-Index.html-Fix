# DeFi Wallets Setup Guide

## Setting Up Your Decentralized Finance Wallets

DeFi wallets give you complete control over your cryptocurrency, but with great power comes great responsibility. This guide will help you set up and secure your DeFi wallets properly.

### Choosing Your Wallet

#### Software Wallets (Hot Wallets)
- **MetaMask:** Most popular browser extension wallet
- **Trust Wallet:** Mobile-first wallet with DApp browser
- **Coinbase Wallet:** User-friendly with DeFi integration

#### Hardware Wallets (Cold Storage)
- **Ledger Nano S/X:** Industry standard hardware wallet
- **Trezor:** Open-source hardware wallet
- **SafePal:** Affordable hardware option

### MetaMask Setup (Recommended for Beginners)

#### Installation
1. Visit metamask.io (verify the URL carefully)
2. Download the browser extension
3. Create a new wallet
4. **CRITICAL:** Write down your 12-word recovery phrase

#### Security Setup
- **Recovery Phrase:** Write it down on paper, never store digitally
- **Multiple Copies:** Store in 2-3 separate secure locations
- **Test Recovery:** Practice wallet recovery before funding
- **Strong Password:** Use a unique password for the wallet

### Essential Security Practices

#### Recovery Phrase Management
- **Never share** your recovery phrase with anyone
- **Never enter** it on websites or apps
- **Physical storage only** - no screenshots or cloud storage
- **Metal backup** recommended for long-term storage

#### Wallet Hygiene
- **Start small:** Test with minimal amounts first
- **Separate wallets:** Consider different wallets for different purposes
- **Regular updates:** Keep wallet software updated
- **Phishing awareness:** Always verify URLs and transactions

### Network Configuration

#### Adding Networks
Popular networks to add:
- **Ethereum Mainnet** (default)
- **Binance Smart Chain**
- **Polygon (Matic)**
- **Arbitrum**

#### Custom Tokens
- Verify token contracts on etherscan.io
- Never add unknown tokens
- Be cautious of airdrops and free tokens

### DeFi Safety Checklist
- [ ] Wallet installed from official source

### Common DeFi Scams to Avoid
- **Fake wallet websites:** Always verify URLs

2. In MetaMask, select "Connect Hardware Wallet"
3. Follow prompts to link accounts
4. Always verify transactions on hardware device
