## Placing Your First Test Trades

Before committing significant capital, it's crucial to practice with small amounts. This guide walks you through placing safe test trades to familiarize yourself with the trading process.

### Why Test Trades Matter

Test trades help you:
- Understand platform interfaces
- Practice order types and execution
- Test your emotional reactions
- Verify your trading setup
- Build confidence before scaling up

### Preparation Before Trading

#### Risk Management Setup
- **Test Amount:** Use only $10-50 for initial tests
- **Stop Loss:** Always set before entering
- **Position Size:** Never risk more than 1-2% of portfolio
- **Exit Strategy:** Plan your exit before entering

#### Platform Familiarization
- Navigate the trading interface
- Understand order types (market, limit, stop)
- Locate important features (charts, order book, trade history)
- Test deposit/withdrawal processes

### Test Trade #1: Simple Long Position

2. Start with a small amount ($10-20)
3. Use a limit order slightly below current market price
